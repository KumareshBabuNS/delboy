Del Boy is a simple Cloud Foundry service broker, written mostly to figure out how to write simple Cloud Foundry service brokers. _Lovely jubbly!_

Right now, this project is mildly interesting only for the mass of JSON matchers in io.pivotal.labs.matchers, which at some point will hopefully move to a project of their own.

Build with Gradle:

--------------------------------------
./gradlew build
